Answer to Problem 7:

2009 Iranian election MSE: 0.0007395833333333335
Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the 2009 Iranian election MSE: 368
Quantity of MSEs smaller than the 2009 Iranian election MSE: 9632
2009 Iranian election null hypothesis rejection level p: 0.0368

There are 9632 of random MSEs that are smaller than Iranian election MSE. There are 368 that are larger. 
This means that only about 3.68% of genuine elections would be as different from the uniform distribution as the Iranian election was. 
Given that, it is highly unlikely that the Iranian election was genuine, so we say that we are 96.32% confident that the data are fraudulent.
As the p value is 0.0368 which is smaller than the threshold of p = 0.05, the Iranian election results were fraudulent.


Answer to Problem 8:

2008 United States election MSE: 0.0001410025876058068
Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the 2008 United States election MSE: 4899
Quantity of MSEs smaller than the 2008 United States election MSE: 5101
2008 United States election null hypothesis rejection level p: 0.4899

There are 5101 MSEs that are smaller than US election MSE. There are 4899 MSEs that are larger than US election MSE. 
This means that about 48.99% of genuine elections would be as different from the uniform distribution as the US election was. 
Given that, US election was highly seem to be genuine, so we say that we are 51.01% confident that the data are not fraudulent.
As the p value is 0.4899 which is larger than the threshold of p = 0.05, the US election results were not fraudulent.
